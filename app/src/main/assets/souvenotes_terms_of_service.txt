<p>By downloading or using Souvenotes, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the application. You are not allowed to copy, or modify, any part of the application, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the application, and you should not try to translate the application into other languages, or make derivative versions. The application itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Souvenotes.</p> <p>Souvenotes is committed to ensuring that the application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the application or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the application or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.</p>
<p>The Souvenotes application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide its Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the application secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the Souvenotes application will not work properly or at all. </p>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Souvenotes will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the application will require the application to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Souvenotes cannot take responsibility for the application not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, and you do not have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are using the application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the application, or other third party charges. By using the application, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the application.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Souvenotes cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the application i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you cannot turn it on to use the Service, Souvenotes cannot accept responsibility.</p>
<p>With respect to the responsibility of Souvenotes for your use of the application, when you are using the application, it is important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Souvenotes accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the application.</p>
<p>At some point, we may wish to update the application. The application is currently available on Android - the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the application. Souvenotes does not promise that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the application, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the application, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
<p><strong>Account Recovery</strong></p>
<p>The email address you use to register for the application (or the email address you associate with the application after initial registration) is used to help you recover your Souvenotes account if you forget your password. If you never had access, or lose access, to this email account, your Souvenotes account recovery cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Content</strong></p>
<p>Souvenotes is not responsible for the content of the ads that you may see in the application.
</p>
<p><strong>Children under The Age of 13 </strong></p>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the application or provide any data to us.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p> We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
